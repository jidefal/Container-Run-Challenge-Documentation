# RUNNING CONTAINER CHALLENGE BY DIVEINTO CLOUD NATIVE BY JAMES SPURIN

Challenge 1:

Use the knowledge you've gained to create and run a container using the ubuntu container image. Run this as an interactive container, without the —rm option and with bash as the command

Install a basic text editor like ‘nano’ or ‘vim’. Install htop and interact and use htop. You will need to make use of the apt package management tools to complete this task

Exit the container and clean up the exited container. Keep the container image

Challenge 2:

Repeat the first challenge but use the amazonlinux image which is based on CentOS to complete the same steps as in challenge 1, you will need to use different package management tools to succeed in this challenge

After completion, exit the container and clean up the exited container. Keep the container image

Challenge 3:

Run a ubuntu container that will automatically clean up after itself, we don’t need to use -it as we will only be running a single command. The command should be cat /etc/os-release

Challenge 4:

Run an amazonlinux container that will automatically clean up after itself, we don’t need to use -it as we will only be running a single command. The command should be cat /etc/os-release

Challenge 5:

Remove the ubuntu container image using the traditional command line approach

Challenge 6:

Remove the amazonlinux container image using the alternative command line approach.
